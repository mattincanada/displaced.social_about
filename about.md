Welcome to the **Displaced.social** Mastodon, a home for like minded Tumblr refugees.


## What makes Displaced.social different from Mastodon.social or other instances?
We're trying to set ourselves apart by offering a safe, open space focused on those in the NSFW LGBT+ community.

## We also..
- Offer larger file upload limits than most Mastodon instances.
- Are completely transparent about our finances and engineering.
- Do not sell advertising and are 100% community supported.
- Plan to offer age verification with profile badges in the near future.
- Cache content in locations around the globe for fast and reliable loading from anywhere.

## Rules
**DO NOT** sign up, if you are under 18!

**You may be asked by @staff to provide identification if there is reasonable doubt of your age. We do this for the protection of the community.**

**NEVER** post illegal content (includes zoophilie and/or bestiality)
**NEVER** post anything containing depictions of children!
**NEVER** post anything containing necrophilia or death!

**The above includes but is not limited to photos, videos, gifs, or illustrations posted publicly, privately, or send in direct messages. If you violate the above your account will be permanently suspended and your content will be purged and/or reported to authorities.**

**DO keep** racism and hate speech to yourself!
**DO** flag posts that don't follow the rules!
**PLEASE** use proper Hashtags describing your content, so other users can find and or filter your content!
**Escorts** and other sex worker related users should use **Switter.at** instead of Displaced.social. Though you are welcome to have an account here to post content you will not be allowed to offer or directly link to your services on this website. We're sorry about this but the FOSTA/SESTA bill in the United States puts us at risk of being shut down.
